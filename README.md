# Python Homework: Matplotlib

**Overview**

This project applies supervised machine learning to two housing datasets to predict property values and price categories using Python (scikit-learn). It demonstrates classification and regression workflows, model tuning, and feature interpretation.

**Boston Housing (Classification)**

- Goal: Predict if median home value > 30 (CAT_MEDV).
- Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree (GridSearchCV, 5-fold CV).
- Best Accuracy: 96% (test).

---

**King County Housing (Regression)**

- Goal: Predict sale price using property features and zip code.
- Model: Decision Tree Regressor (tuned via GridSearchCV).
- Best MAE: ~119K on test data.
